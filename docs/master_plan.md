# CypherEngine Master Development Plan

Last updated: 2026-06-27

This document is the long-form plan for building CypherEngine into a serious game engine runtime, toolchain, and later Mason editor.

It is intentionally practical. The goal is not to copy CryEngine, idTech, Dark Engine, Source, or Source 2. The goal is to learn from their shape:

- explicit engine subsystems
- virtual filesystem and package-backed content
- data-driven resources
- serious renderer ownership
- editor/runtime separation
- tools that build real game data
- debugging, profiling, and diagnostics everywhere

The project should grow because systems need real behavior, not because a large file count looks impressive.

## Current Baseline

As of 2026-06-12, the repository has roughly:

- 21.5k lines of C/C++ source and tests
- 24k lines including documentation

Current implemented or partially implemented systems:

- `CypherCommon`
- `CypherLog`
- `CypherSystem`
- `CypherHost`
- `CypherMemory`
- `CypherFileSystem`
- `CypherPak`
- `CypherMath`
- `CypherRender`
- `CypherCommand`
- `CypherCVar`
- `CypherConfig`

Current future subsystem folders exist for:

- `CypherPlatform`
- `CypherInput`
- `CypherResource`
- `CypherWorld`
- `CypherEntity`
- `CypherPhysics`
- `CypherAudio`
- `CypherAI`
- `CypherAnimation`
- `CypherNetwork`
- `CypherScript`
- `CypherProfile`
- `CypherConsole`
- `CypherEditor`
- `CypherTools`

## What "Grade-A" Means Here

For this project, Grade-A does not mean matching a AAA commercial engine feature-for-feature.

It means:

- the runtime builds consistently
- major subsystems have clear ownership
- APIs return explicit errors instead of failing silently
- memory lifetimes are intentional
- assets load through engine-owned paths
- packages and loose files use one virtual namespace
- renderer, world, physics, audio, and resources interact through stable contracts
- tests cover core behavior
- debugging and diagnostics are built into the engine
- the engine can ship a real game, not only demos
- tools and editor can be added without rewriting the runtime

## Reference Engine Lessons

These are architectural lessons only. Do not copy implementation code.

### idTech 3 / Quake III

Useful lessons:

- small, explicit C-style systems
- virtual filesystem and pak search paths
- command/cvar/config backbone
- clean client/server thinking
- data-oriented renderer submission
- game/runtime boundary
- console-driven development workflow

What to avoid:

- copying old platform assumptions blindly
- locking into old fixed-function rendering ideas
- assuming old networking decisions are enough for modern needs

### Early CryEngine

Useful lessons:

- large subsystem separation
- editor and runtime grown together over time
- resource compiler and cooked assets
- terrain, vegetation, renderer, AI, physics, and editor treated as first-class systems
- many files because tooling, diagnostics, formats, and platform paths create real complexity

What to avoid:

- chasing file count
- adding giant interfaces before runtime pressure exists
- building editor UI before runtime data is stable

### Dark Engine / Looking Glass Style Systems

Useful lessons:

- world simulation matters
- entity/object data can drive emergent gameplay
- tools and authored data are central
- gameplay systems need editor-visible data eventually

What to avoid:

- opaque data flows
- hard-to-debug object communication

### Source / Source 2 Style Direction

Useful lessons:

- editor and tools need strong asset database behavior
- packages, resources, maps, materials, and compiled formats are a production pipeline
- hot reload and inspection are not optional long term
- viewport editing is only the visible part of a much larger toolchain

What to avoid:

- starting with the editor before the runtime can load, render, simulate, and save real data

## Total Size Targets

LOC is not the goal, but LOC helps understand scope.

| Scope | Approx LOC | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| Current project | 21k-25k | early foundation |
| First serious runtime | 80k-150k | can build a playable FPS loop with engine-owned loading/render/world basics |
| Strong solo runtime | 180k-350k | resource system, renderer, physics integration, audio, profiling, gameplay framework |
| Runtime plus tools | 250k-500k | asset compiler, map compiler, pak tool, resource compiler, import/cook path |
| Runtime plus editor | 400k-800k | serious Mason editor with viewport, inspector, asset browser, editing tools |
| Long-term engine ecosystem | 600k-1M+ | advanced editor, networking, scripting, full pipeline, content, platform polish |

The first real target is not 900k LOC.

The first real target is:

- 100k useful LOC
- one playable vertical slice
- one reliable asset pipeline
- one renderer path that can draw actual game content

## Work Method

Use this process for every subsystem:

1. Define the subsystem boundary.
2. Write the public API first.
3. Write the data structures.
4. Write pseudocode for the important flows.
5. Implement the smallest real version.
6. Add smoke tests.
7. Add edge case tests.
8. Add diagnostics.
9. Document the policy.
10. Commit in small chunks.

Rules:

- one active subsystem at a time
- one active milestone at a time
- do not jump into editor work before runtime data is real
- do not build abstractions without pressure
- make all failure modes explicit
- keep code C++20, but C-style and data-oriented
- use free functions and structs by default
- avoid inheritance unless a stable interface truly needs it
- prefer engine-owned handles over raw object ownership in public APIs

## Current Phase Completion Targets

### VFS/Pak Complete For Current Phase

Complete when:

- package format is documented
- all public APIs have expected behavior
- unsupported operations return explicit unsupported errors
- mount priorities work
- package unmount works
- directory listing works across loose and package data
- recursive find works
- package reads are read-only
- package info and file info work
- tests pass

Not required yet:

- compression
- streaming package reads
- package editor UI
- full asset database

### Memory Complete For Current Phase

Complete when:

- arena, pool, bucket, scratch paths work
- markers and rewinds work
- thread-local scratch exists
- debug statistics exist
- leaks can be reported
- tests cover normal and invalid usage

Not required yet:

- full platform virtual memory backend
- advanced lock-free allocators
- editor memory visualizer

### Resource Complete For First Runtime Phase

Complete when:

- resources are loaded through VFS
- handles are stable
- shaders/textures/meshes/materials have resource paths
- renderer consumes resources cleanly
- failed loads report useful errors
- reload direction exists

Not required yet:

- full asset database
- all import formats
- editor integration

## Testing And CI Plan

Short term:

- keep smoke tests for each subsystem
- run CMake build locally before commits
- run CTest before pushes
- GitHub Actions macOS build/test

Near term:

- add Linux CI once SDL3 dependency path is clean
- add Windows CI once the platform path is ready
- add sanitizer builds
- add warning-as-error job when noise is controlled

Long term:

- resource load tests
- package corruption tests
- renderer headless tests where possible
- asset compiler tests
- map compiler tests
- gameplay simulation tests

## Documentation Plan

Maintain these docs:

- `docs/current_status.md`
- `docs/roadmap.md`
- `docs/development_phases.md`
- `docs/master_plan.md`
- subsystem policy docs
- API reference docs
- changelog

Policy:

- every serious subsystem gets a policy doc
- every file format gets a format doc
- every major system gets tests before being called stable

## Commit And Git Policy

Current project rule:

- commit directly to `main` when requested
- one changed file per commit when requested
- do not commit `AGENTS.md`
- do not create feature branches unless explicitly asked
- run build/tests before pushing

## What Not To Do Yet

Do not start these before their prerequisites:

- full editor before resources/world are real
- advanced networking before a local game loop exists
- full rigid body physics before movement/collision pressure exists
- custom scripting VM before native gameplay loop proves API needs
- terrain/vegetation before renderer/world basics are solid
- massive abstraction layers before at least two systems need them

## The Line To Draw

The correct path is:

1. finish foundation
2. make assets load through the engine
3. make the renderer draw engine-owned resources
4. make a controllable world
5. make collision and gameplay work
6. make tools for the content pipeline
7. start Mason
8. grow editor and runtime together

The engine becomes large naturally when it has real coverage:

- runtime
- tools
- editor
- game
- tests
- diagnostics
- documentation

The project should chase finished behavior, not file count.
