# CypherEngine Documentation Hub

This is the navigation root for CypherEngine.

`CypherEngine` is the engine runtime and tools foundation. `REAP` is the current game direction being explored on top of it.

Read these in order when resuming work:

1. [current_status.md](current_status.md)
2. [master_plan.md](master_plan.md)
3. [development_phases.md](development_phases.md)
4. [roadmap.md](roadmap.md)
5. [project_structure.md](project_structure.md)
6. [architecture.md](architecture.md)
7. [subsystems.md](subsystems.md)
8. [toolchain_plan.md](toolchain_plan.md)
9. [reference_engine_lessons.md](reference_engine_lessons.md)

## What each document is for

- `current_status`
  - what is active now
  - what is done-for-now
  - what is intentionally deferred
- `master_plan`
  - the full long-term implementation schedule
  - concrete near-term dates
  - subsystem LOC ranges
  - runtime, toolchain, editor, and game progression
- `development_phases`
  - the current build order
  - what should be implemented next and why
- `roadmap`
  - compact version of the larger build sequence
- `project_structure`
  - the intended full repo layout
- `architecture`
  - top-level boundaries
  - ownership rules
- `subsystems`
  - what each module is responsible for
- `toolchain_plan`
  - how maps, models, archives, scripts, and tools should be introduced
- `reference_engine_lessons`
  - architecture lessons from reference engines
  - legal boundary for study-only source trees
  - practical lessons for VFS, memory, resources, renderer, world, tools and editor
- `CYPHERENGINE_API_REFERENCE`
  - the public engine-facing API surface that currently exists
- `CYPHERENGINE_API_IMPLEMENTATION`
  - how the current API is backed internally and where it still needs work
