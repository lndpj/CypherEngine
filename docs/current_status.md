# CypherEngine Current Status

## Project state

CypherEngine is still in early foundation stage, but the runtime stack is now more real than the old docs implied.

`CypherEngine` is the native engine runtime currently living in this repository.

Current code snapshot:

- early runtime modules live under `src/CypherEngine/`
- build succeeds through CMake
- the executable target is `cypherengine`
- the runtime can create a window, initialize OpenGL, load shaders, and submit a basic mesh path
- a CryEngine-inspired future subsystem skeleton now exists for editor, tools, resources, world, input, physics, audio, AI, animation, networking, scripting, and profiling
- `CypherCommon` has moved into a broader Tier0/Tier1 foundation with active string, char, test and benchmark work

## What exists now

- foundational types and shared error surface
- common formatted print/error helpers
- memory arenas and pools with benchmark coverage
- logging runtime
- early platform runtime helpers
- host lifecycle scaffold
- SDL3 window creation and event polling
- filesystem mount/read path
- CypherPak package archive path
- OpenGL context bootstrap through GLAD
- renderer lifecycle, shader, mesh, camera, and draw-list path
- vector, matrix, quaternion, bounds, ray, plane, and frustum math
- command system backend
- cvar system backend
- cfg loading/execution backend
- documentation/process system
- Catch2 tests and Google Benchmark targets for the current foundation

## Active milestone

`M6 - Common, Diagnostics, and Resource Ownership Preparation`

This milestone is complete only when:

- `CypherCommon_String` implements its declared API with correctness tests
- Common hot paths have benchmark coverage before SIMD work begins
- `CypherCommon_Simd` is designed as an optimization layer above tested scalar code
- VFS/Pak production lessons are documented for missing-file, opened-file and package diagnostics
- `CypherResource` has a first asset-handle direction for shaders, meshes, textures and materials
- renderer draw submission starts moving toward resource handles instead of raw pointers

## Immediate next tasks

1. finish the remaining `CypherCommon_String` function groups
2. add tests and benchmarks group by group
3. design `CypherCommon_Simd` for SSE2/NEON after scalar String is stable
4. add profiling/diagnostic skeletons needed to measure runtime growth
5. introduce `CypherResource` as the asset lifetime layer
6. return to input, fly-camera, and renderer material/texture work after Resource exists

## Explicitly not active yet

- real custom world/map runtime implementation
- client/server networking
- gameplay loop
- custom model/material/archive tooling
- custom editor tooling
- VM/game-script runtime
- full SIMD string/memory/math backend

These are all intended, but they are not the current coding target.

## Resume rule

If work pauses, resume from this file first.

Do not restart architecture design from scratch unless this file and the surrounding docs are intentionally updated with a new direction.
