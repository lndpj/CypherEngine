# CypherEngine Project Structure

This is the intended long-term CypherEngine repository structure.

`CypherEngine` is the engine runtime. The game name can stay separate once the actual game identity is locked.

## Meaning of each top-level directory

- `src/CypherEngine`
  - native CypherEngine runtime
- `src/CypherEngine/CypherCommon`

- `src/CypherEngine/CypherSystem`
  - central engine lifetime orchestration; long-term replacement for host-style bootstrapping
- `src/CypherEngine/CypherPlatform`
  - OS/window/platform backends; current platform code can migrate here later
- `src/CypherEngine/CypherMemory`
  - arenas, pools, memory stats, diagnostics, and allocator backends
- `src/CypherEngine/CypherFileSystem`
  - mounted paths, virtual paths, file handles, archive/package access
- `src/CypherEngine/CypherConsole`
  - developer console front-end over commands and CVars
- `src/CypherEngine/CypherCommand`
  - command registration and execution
- `src/CypherEngine/CypherCVar`
  - runtime variables, flags, and tweakable settings
- `src/CypherEngine/CypherConfig`
  - cfg file loading and command-line config execution
- `src/CypherEngine/CypherResource`
  - asset handles, loading, dependencies, reload, and lifecycle tracking

  - map/world source data, object placement, scene ownership, level metadata
- `src/CypherEngine/CypherEntity`
  - entity identity, component ownership, and game-object runtime bridge
- `src/CypherEngine/CypherInput`
  - keyboard, mouse, controller, input contexts, editor/game routing
- `src/CypherEngine/CypherPhysics`
  - collision, traces, physics bodies, simulation, and movement helpers

## Important note about the current repo

The current source already lives under `src/CypherEngine/`, with CryEngine-style subsystem folders such as `CypherRender`, `CypherSystem`, and `CypherFileSystem`.

Future migrations should add new `Cypher*` modules beside the existing runtime modules instead of inventing a different architecture each time.

`CypherSystem` currently contains some platform/window code. Long term,
platform-specific code should migrate into `CypherPlatform`, leaving
`CypherSystem` free to become the central engine orchestration layer.

Empty future folders may exist before implementation. They are architectural
parking spaces, not a promise that those systems are complete.

## Key architectural message

This project is not just one executable.

It is a family of connected systems:
- native engine runtime
- scripting VM
- gameplay layer
- tools pipeline
- asset/data tree

That is why the structure must be explicit.
