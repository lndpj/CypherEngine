# CypherEngine

CypherEngine is a C++20 game engine project with C-style runtime code.

The engine is being built from scratch for learning and for eventually making a real 3D game. The codebase favors plain structs, free functions, explicit ownership, module prefixes, and data-oriented systems over class-heavy architecture.

Current work includes a common runtime layer, custom memory allocators, virtual filesystem, CypherPak package archives, SDL3 windowing, OpenGL/glad rendering bootstrap, math foundations, logging, config, commands, cvars, tests, and benchmarks.

CypherEngine studies ideas from idTech, GoldSrc/Source, and early CryEngine-era engines as engineering references. It is not a fork and does not copy their implementations.
