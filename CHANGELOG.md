# CypherEngine Changelog

All notable changes to CypherEngine and the REAP game/runtime direction are tracked here.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-04 to 2026-06-18

### Added
- Added the CypherMemory allocator foundation with arena, pool, bucket, scratch, and thread-aware allocation paths.
- Added filesystem path normalization, root normalization, path joining, basename, dirname, extension, and extension-stripping helpers.
- Added VFS directory and discovery APIs for create, delete, remove tree, rename, copy, exists, file info, directory listing, and find-file workflows.
- Added VFS mount handles, mount priority ordering, mount inspection, unmounting, and trace-resolve diagnostics.
- Added package-backed VFS reads through CypherPak integration, including package mount, unmount, package info, package file open/read/seek/tell, directory listing, find, and copy-out behavior.
- Added filesystem watch API coverage with snapshot-based polling for created, modified, and deleted loose-file changes.
- Added Windows native file-watch groundwork using `ReadDirectoryChangesW`, fixed native watch slot storage, directory handle creation, async event creation, overlapped state, watch arming, and native cleanup on unwatch.
- Added GitHub Actions CI coverage across Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu with Debug/Release builds, CTest execution, and Ubuntu sanitizer coverage.

### Changed
- Renamed common log/print usage toward shorter engine-facing macros and helpers.
- Tightened subsystem error naming so filesystem, memory, pak, render, host, command, cvar, config, and common errors remain distinct.
- Strengthened the VFS write path model so writes resolve through the configured write root while reads resolve through mounted roots and package overlays.
- Improved package/VFS overlay behavior so higher-priority package content can override loose mounted content while still falling back after unmount.
- Updated CI to use modern checkout, explicit permissions, concurrency cancellation, stricter CTest failure handling, and platform dependency setup.
- Kept native platform code behind platform macros while preserving the public VFS API as platform-neutral.

### Fixed
- Fixed cross-platform CI failures from compiler differences, Windows CRT text-mode translation, Linux dependencies, and overly large temporary filesystem watch state.
- Fixed VFS watch cleanup so active watches are unwatched before filesystem shutdown clears runtime state.
- Fixed watch flag validation so recursive watching must still specify a file or directory watch mode.
- Fixed package file handle behavior for read, seek, tell, EOF reads, permission-denied writes, and package unmount fallback.

### Verified
- Verified filesystem and package smoke tests locally.
- Verified CI passing across Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, Release/Debug, and Ubuntu ASan/UBSan jobs.

### Notes
- Native Windows watching is now created and armed, but event parsing still needs to convert `FILE_NOTIFY_INFORMATION` records into engine `watch_event_t` records.
- Linux `inotify`, macOS native watching, and async filesystem IO remain the next VFS work items.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Added package-backed VFS support for mounting packages and reading, listing, finding, and copying files through the virtual filesystem.
- Added tests covering CypherPak package behavior and VFS package integration.
- Added GitHub Actions CI coverage for automated build and test verification.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added
- Added the tracked future subsystem folder skeleton inspired by early CryEngine-style engine/editor/tool separation:
  - `CypherPlatform`
  - `CypherInput`
  - `CypherResource`
  - `CypherWorld`
  - `CypherEntity`
  - `CypherPhysics`
  - `CypherAudio`
  - `CypherAI`
  - `CypherAnimation`
  - `CypherNetwork`
  - `CypherScript`
  - `CypherProfile`
  - `CypherConsole`
  - `CypherEditor`
  - `CypherTools`
- Added tool placeholder folders for future asset, map, and resource compiler work:
  - `tools/CypherAssetCompiler`
  - `tools/CypherMapCompiler`
  - `tools/CypherResourceCompiler`

### Changed
- Updated the project structure documentation around the long-term CypherEngine layout.
- Updated the coding style documentation to define the Cypher module naming law:
  - `Cypher*` subsystem folders
  - `snake_case_t` data types
  - `*_desc_t`, `*_state_t`, and `*_handle_t` type conventions
  - explicit subsystem-prefixed free functions
  - future `I*` interfaces only for stable editor/runtime/tool contracts
- Updated the README to remove stale `REAP` absolute links, describe the new subsystem skeleton, and align the project identity around Cypher Software.

### Notes
- No C++ implementation files were intentionally changed as part of this architecture pass.
- Empty future subsystem directories are tracked with placeholder files until real implementation files exist.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-05

### Changed
- Kept public subsystem functions on the branded `CypherRender_*`, `CypherSystem_*`, `CypherCommon_*` style.
- Cleaned subsystem types back to namespace-local names such as `render::shader_t`, `render::mesh_t`, `sys::window_t`, `host::state_t`, and `common::error_t`.
- Removed the renderer-owned temporary triangle mesh/shader draw path so the renderer now only draws submitted draw items.
- Updated CypherEngine build metadata to describe the custom idTech/GoldSrc/early CryEngine-inspired runtime direction.

### Verified
- Confirmed the cleaned naming pass builds successfully with CMake using a fresh verification build directory.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-02

  - frustum point containment
  - frustum-vs-bounds intersection testing
- Added plane construction helpers for building planes from point/normal pairs and triangle points.

### Fixed
- Fixed frustum bounds testing to use real AABB half-extents when projecting bounds onto frustum plane normals.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- Designed the camera frustum path around six world-space planes extracted from `projection * view`.
- Documented the renderer culling direction: object/world bounds are tested against camera frustum planes before draw submission.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- Added `math_bounds` for AABB creation, expansion, center/size queries, point containment, and bounds overlap.
- Added `math_ray` for ray point evaluation, ray-plane intersection, and ray-bounds slab intersection.
- Added `ray_t` to the math type layer for future traces, picking, collision, and weapon-fire tests.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- Added `math_plane` for signed plane distance and front/back/on-plane point classification.
- Added `plane_t`, `bounds_t`, and frustum-oriented math type definitions as the geometry foundation for BSP, collision, and renderer culling.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- Added the first custom engine math library pass:
  - vector helpers
  - matrix helpers
  - quaternion helpers
  - projection/view/model transform support
- Added quaternion rotation support including construction, normalization, inverse/conjugate, multiplication, vector rotation, matrix conversion, NLerp, and Slerp.

### Changed

  - column-major storage
  - column-vector transforms
  - right-handed world convention
  - `projection * view * model` transform order

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- Added SDL3 window creation and runtime event plumbing through the `sys` and `host` layers.
- Added the first OpenGL renderer backend path with SDL GL context creation, GLAD function loading, frame begin/end, and buffer clearing.
- Added shader, mesh, and renderer scaffolding for moving from test drawing toward real engine assets.

### Changed
- Moved host startup toward a cleaner orchestration path where `main` stays minimal and host owns subsystem initialization.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- Added cleanup of the host initializaion

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- Added game/engine identity direction for `REAP`, `CypherEngine`, internal `CypherEngine`, and `Spark Software`.
- Started shaping the proper `sys_` platform layer around startup descriptors, platform/compiler identity, paths, time, sleep, and local-time services.

### Changed
- Removed bulky comments from public engine headers so API surfaces are easier to read while the engine architecture is still forming.
- Cleaned `sys_platform.h` into a compact platform API surface.
- Hid VFS runtime state inside `fs_main.cpp` instead of exposing it through public headers.

### Fixed
- Fixed cfg comment stripping so `//` comments stop parsing at the correct point instead of breaking the scan too early.
- Kept the project building cleanly after the header cleanup and VFS implementation work.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-26

  - `SDL3`, `OpenGL`, `Quake III BSP`, `rmdl`, and `rpk` as the long-term technical path.
- Added API documentation anchors:
  - `docs/CYPHERENGINE_API_REFERENCE.md`
  - `docs/CYPHERENGINE_API_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

### Changed
- Completed the cfg system enough to load files and dispatch parsed lines through `cfg_execute_line`.
